   General modifications
   ---------------------

   - The majority of version 1.7 is comprised of revision number 2476;
     branching took place under revision 2476 from dev/ to branches/RC1.7/
   - A number of modifications were made to Jamfiles and Makefiles, and some
     tweaks to code for clean compilation, for compatibility with the latest
     Cygwin, Windows 7 VS, Solaris and Mac Snow Leopard (OSX 6.6).  Release 
     during the week of 21 February 2011.
   - Major additions to dev/apps/bindings/octave for a SWIG-based interface to
     the MATLAB-like language Octave. SWIG-based Octave wrapper added for most
     library classes. Additions listed below, modifications not involving new
     functionality omitted in this summary.
   - Major addition of dev/lib/geodyn library. Additions listed below,
     modifications not involving new functionality omitted in this summary.
   - Essential documentation and minimal examples were added for various 
     graphics formats in /ref/graphics/.
   - This release includes new/modified source code comments for improved
     readability.
   - Cleaned up and added comments to various examples to make them more
     useful.
   - The next planned release, GPSTk v2.0, will be a major upgrade and will
     merge the RINEX 3 development branch back into the trunk; 
     GPSTk v1.7 is expected to be the last 1.x release.

          position string with leading spaces to a Position.  SourceForge Bug
          ID #1530502.

       StringUtils.hpp
          Fixed namespace issue: strtod, strtoul, strtol declared in cstdlib
          but this was not included in StringUtils causing an error on some
          platforms. Also fixed formatting issue. Also modified to eliminate
          definition conflict with Windows "max" function.

          algorithm. Fixed missing bracket and cleaned up per GPSTk coding 
          standards.

       /positioning/rinexpvt.[h|c]pp
          Fixed namespace issue. strtod, strtoul and strtol are declared in
          cstdlib but this wasn't included in StringUtils causing an error on
          some platforms. Also, added Yuma and SEM capability.

       /MDPtools/MDPProcessors.[h|c]pp
          Moved header checks to after the entire message has been read.

          option (-f).

       /filetools/navdmp.cpp
          Fixed navdmp so that datefiltering works now. The data are filtered 
          based upon the transmission rather than the epoch date. Related to 
          SourceForge bug #1196179.

       /filetools/fic2rin.cpp
          Added an argument to fic2rin. Extra argument is --9 | --109 | --all
          which will either convert block 9, block 109, or block 9 and 109 data
          to the RINEX file. Formerly converting block 9 was the default, and 
          still is. Argument must be specified at end of parameter list. If
          left blank, defaults to block 9 only.


       /MDPtools/mdpEdit.cpp
          Added a more useful prn exclusion/inclusion mechanism.

       /visibility/DiscreteVisibleCounts.cpp

       /ObsArrayEvaluator/ObsArray.cpp
          Modified DataAvailabilityAnalyzer and ObsArray to handle ObsReader
          changes. DataAvailabilityAnalyzer now accounts for all missing
          epochs when start and stop times are specified. Some messages output
          by DataAvailabilityAnalyzer reworked.

       /DataAvailability/DataAvailabilityAnalyzer.[h|c]pp
          Added a command-line option for specification of the observation
          interval. Also modified accounting for missing data epochs and fixed
          some errors in the summary when all epochs are missed.

       /Rinextools/RinSum.cpp
          Added antenna offset to output, added option to output lsit of gaps,
          fixed some minor bugs and improved the code.

       /Rinextools/RinexEditor.cpp
          Accompanying fix to RinexObsHeader to permit Mixed file system.

       /reszilla/ordPlot
          Implemented the --warts option fully in ordPlot.

       /reszilla/ordClock.cpp
       /reszilla/ordPlot
          Fixed plotting output with only warts. Increased the clock tolerance
          for marking of wonky ord clocks.

       /reszilla/ordStats.cpp
          Added median absolute deviation and median to output.

       /reszilla/ordGen.cpp
          Now chooses the last entry for a given station in an MSC file.

       /MDPtools/Jamfile
       /MDPtools/MDPProcessors.[h|c]pp
       /MDPtools/mdptool.cpp
          Made the mdpscreen build conditional (Jamfile). Added a fast mode for
          converting to a new file.

       /positioning/posInterp.cpp
          Geomatics update.

       /geomatics/cycleslips/DiscFix.cpp
          Fixed DayTime constructor (constant) v. constant issue, plus most
          C->C++ endl.

       /geomatics/relposition/CommandInput.cpp
          Fixed SourceForge bug #2876038. Bug occurred when using multiple
          fixed stations for DDBase. More info on SourceForge bug tracker site.

       /geomatics/relposition/Configure.cpp
          Minor change so that weather data is interpolated from tabular values
          and scaled for height properly when using the NewB tropo model.

       /geomatics/relposition/DDBase.cpp
          Updated version string and date for release.

       /converters/novaRinex.cpp
          Open temporary file on Windows in env(TEMP) directory; necessary for
          Vista. Later added fix to address breakage related to changes in 
          /dev/src/RinexSatID (rev2319). However, fix only allows GPS system
          type. Later fix added malformed message and large NovatelData records
          handling.

       /difftools/rowdiff.cpp
          Modified to: indicate to the user if the two files contain different
          data types; output to the screen the data types contained in each
          file; indicate to the user if no differences were found.

       /filetools/EphSum.cpp
          Corrected reported end of effectivity times.

       /multipath/SparseBinnedStats.hpp
       /multipath/ValarrayUtils.[h|c]pp
       /multipath/mpsolve.cpp
       /multipath/tstSparseBinnedStats.cpp
          Major upgrade to mpsolve. Added bias resolution routines and cleaned
          up code.

       /multipath/ObsArray.cpp
       /multipath/mpsolve.cpp
          Now mpsolve uses robust statistic to detect and remove data affected
          by cycle slips. Also can process a directory of files and can make
          surface plots of its solutions. Paper is in the works. Also, mpsolve
          user can edit out days when processing large directories of data.
          Also added zero mean assumption to add final de-bias/constraint on
          DFM processing. Disabled position solution consistency check. Also in
          mpsolve fixed two bugs: one for the DFM method when no intersections 
          were found, one for the DFM method when a pass exists that is less
          than two points.

       /multipath/mpsim.cpp
          Added capability to generate random Gaussian numbers. Comment
          corrected.

Version 1.4   Tuesday, December 18, 2007

	General modifications
	---------------------

	- Majority of version 1.4 comprised of revision number 863 
	  branching took place under revision 864 from dev/ to RC1.4/
	
	- Major refactoring of the Ephemeris/Almanac classes. This change may 
	  break some apps. To fix them the following translations are useful:
	
              Old                           |        New
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    gpstk::EphemerisStore		    | gpstk::XvtStore<gpstk::SatID>
    gpstk::BCEphemerisStore		    | gpstk::GPSEphemerisStore
    gpstk::AlmanacStore                     | gpstk::GPSAlmanacStore
    gpstk::EphemerisStore::NoEphemerisFound | gpstk::InvalidRequest
    eph.getSatXvt(sat, time)	            | eph.getXvt(sat, time)
    eph.getSatXvt(prn, time)		    | eph.getXvt(SatID(prn, SatID::systemGPS), time)
    eph.dump(0, cout)			    | eph.dump(cout, 0)


        - Added an updated LaTeX source for table describing apps of v1.3, 
	        as well as a list of classes in the gpstk libraries 
	        (sorted & categorized) found in ref/glance/

	- Added LeTex source for the GPSTk paper at the ION-GNSS-2006

	- Added a library /dev/lib/vplot/ to create drawing primitives in SVG 
	        and postscript formats. Intended to support complex, fully 
	        customizable visualizations on GNSS analyses. Supported only 
	        in jam for now,	but with the hope of support in make.

	- Improved version control 
	  * set gpstk package version to 1.3 in the autoconf build world
	  * set the current shared library major version to 13, so gpstk 1.3
	    delivers lib{gpstk,rxio,mdplib,...}.so.13.0
	  * now allows jam and make to build shared libraries with the 
	    appropriate versions
	  * causes jam to install headers to $PREFIX/include/gpstk to prevent 
	    header namespace collision. This behaviour is consistent with the 
	    "make" build.

	- Moved apps/geomatics/lib library to dev/lib/geomatics

Version 1.1   Friday, January 7, 2005

	General modifications
	---------------------

	- Added patches to support more compilers:
	     GNU compiler version 3.4
	     GNU compiler under AIX
	     Sun ONE Studio 8

	- GNU make/configure capabilities have been added. Since this
	  is a new feature, your mileage may vary. The makefiles
	  work on systems with newer autoconf toolchain versions.

	- More examples were added to gpstk/examples.
	  These examples are described in the website.

	- Major revamp of the website.
	
	Library modifications
	---------------------

	- P code generator was allocating over 20 megabytes in
	  processes that use the shared library. Now the 20 megabytes
	  are not allocated until the P code generator is initialized
	  by the user.
	
	- Bug fix: FileSpec::extractDayTime() now initializes
	  DayTimes generated from file name to have zero hours,
	  zero minutes, zero seconds, etc.
	
	- Bug fix: DayTime::setGPS now more robust when accepting
	  a year number as a hint to disambiguate which full GPS
	  week to use.
	
	- Added more DayTime tests.
	
	- Bug fix: DayTime user-defined tolerance for comparisons now is
	  working.

	- Bug fix: DayTime::setGPS(short week, long zcount, short year)
	  now works across a year rollover.
	
	- Renamed WxObsData::find(...) to getWxObservation(...) to remove
	  any confusion that might develop over having the same method
	  name as the STL.
	
	- Bug fix: satellite combinations in RAIM sometimes incorrect when 
	  a user-marked satellite was present.

	- Some Vector routines were throwing Exception instead of 
	  VectorException.

	- Added Vector-Matrix concatentation operators.

	- Added a sub-Vector constructor.

	- Modification to Householder decomposition routine.
	
	- Various fixes to MatrixOperators.

	- Updates to FIC routines.

	- Implemented azimuth and elevation functions in Position, making 
	  use of the functions inherited from Triple. Modified EphemerisRange
	  to use Position, as well as TropModel and ResCor; this eliminated 
	  a bug in the azimuth() in EphemerisRange and means that now there 
	  is only one implementation of az and el. Added a test of the new 
	  routines in positiontest. Also added a Position constructor from Xvt.

	- Bugs in DayTime::setToString() - %f was missing (!) and %S 
	  was acting as %f should; date was trashed when time was set, 
	  and vice versa, and year input was not properly handled.

	- Implemented ionospheric model types other than linear.

	- Cleaned up weather data handling (e.g., error checks).

	
	Application modifications
	-------------------------
	
	apps/difftools

	- Unified code using a common class.
